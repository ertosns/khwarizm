      <p>Imagine you want send a message to your fiend (Alice) in next building via electric wires, How you build that communication system? steps:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>connect two electric wires (channel) one for sending (S), and other for recieving (R) between you and Alice</li>
          <li>connect R with bulb and S with switch<img src = "{{site.baseurl}}/img/you_and_alice_communication_system.png" width  = "7	0%"></li>
          <li>define set of rules between you and Alice (protocol) for example bulb ON for 1 second then off for 1 second that may mean character A, but english alphabets are 26 charachter + space' ' = 27  then you need log2(27) = 4.75 ~ 5 states. protocol to decode [A-Z + ' '] will be as follow.
           <ol>
              <li> ON(1sec) ON(1sec) ON(1sec) ON(1sec) ON(1sec) = 'A'</li>

     <p>now the system ready to work, not that each character needs 1 second. to say "hello Alice"  you need 11 sec the message will be as follow <b>ON ON OFF OFF OFF ON ON OFF ON ON ON OFF ON OFF OFF ON OFF ON OFF OFF ON OFF OFF OFF ON OFF OFF ON OFF OFF ON ON ON ON ON ON OFF ON OFF OFF ON OFF ON ON ON ON ON ON OFF ON ON ON OFF ON ON</b> tedious right? we will make simple sooner in this series.

     <p>
     that was the idea of first electric communication system ever build (Telegraph) but instead of ON(1 sec) and OFF(1 sec) dot(ON for period less than dash) and dash(ON for period longer than dot) and that much better protocol which prevent many problem for instance How Alice know when you start and end sending character 'Z' ? it has only two ON states another difference instead of light bulb sound or magnetic pointer is used which is more practical.</p>

     how send multiple signals?
     how make it faster? 
     how attach transmitter and reciever?
     how line in internet work in real world?
     bandwidth.
